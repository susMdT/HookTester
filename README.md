# HookTester
Testing bypassing function hooks with Pinvoke and Dinvoke methods. Utilizes a hook onto CreateProcessA.  
Note that I'm using basically the same dinvoke code from my dinvoke_stuff repo so some of it is probably unnecessary.  
I think that NaxAlpha's code only works when VS compiled debug + any processor so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.
Credit to NaxAlpha for his code (https://gist.github.com/NaxAlpha/144d1dd96c7d0ad29fe149e4063a8f25) that was used as the base for the hook tester.
